# Hometask: String Parser with callback functions

## You should type on command line:
    
    if you want to pass tests:
        -> make test
        
    if you want to clear all created files:
        -> make clear
        

#### String Parser with callback functions is algorithm which can call extra functions when will see a special token like number or string. Number is a part of whole string divided by backspaces and string  is all the rest. Callback function should have view like 

```c++
void (*) (std::string &a), void (*) (float a)
```
