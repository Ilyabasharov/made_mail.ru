# Hometask: Quick select algorithm with random choosing pivot

## You should type on command line:
    
    if you want to run:
        -> make run
        
    if you want to clear all created files:
        -> make clear
        
#### Was given  whole numbers sequence in range from [0, 1e9] with length n. You should print number k which would stand on position with index k in [0, n - 1] in sorted sequence. You should write non recursive algorithm. Average time complexity have to be O(n), memory usage O(n). Description:

#### Input format:

    -> The first line contains the number of elements in sequence n and k 0 ≤ k < n ≤ 1,000,000,000.
    -> The second line contains long long sequence with elements in range long int.
       
#### Output format:
    
        Example:
        
        input                       |   output
        10 4                        |   5
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10        |
