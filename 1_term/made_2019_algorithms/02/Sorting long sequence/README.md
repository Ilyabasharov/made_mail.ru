# Hometask: Sorting long long sequence 

## You should type on command line:
    
    if you want to run:
        -> make run
        
    if you want to test:
        -> make test
        
    if you want to clear all created files:
        -> make clear
        
#### Was given long long whole numbers sequence with length n. You should print first k minimal elements from long long sequence. This sequence cannot be keeped in memory entirely. Time complexity have to be O(n*log(k)), memory usage O(k). Description:

#### Input format:

    ->  The first line contains the number of elements in sequence n and k 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000,000.
    ->  The second line contains long long sequence with elements in range long int.
       
#### Output format:

    ->  You should to print first k minimal elements from long long sequence.
    
        Example:
        
        input                     |   output
        9 4                       |   1 2 3 4
        3 7 4 5 6 1 15 4 2        |
